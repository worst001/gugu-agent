# feat(ce-slack-researcher): Add Slack analyst research agent with workflow integration

## Overview

Add a new research agent (`ce-slack-researcher`) to the compound-engineering plugin that searches Slack for organizational context relevant to the current task. Integrate it as a conditional parallel dispatch in ce-ideate, ce-plan, and ce-brainstorm, with two-level short-circuiting to avoid token waste when the Slack MCP is not connected.

## Problem Frame

Coding agents have no visibility into organizational knowledge that lives in Slack — decisions, constraints, ongoing discussions about projects. The official Slack plugin provides user-facing commands but no programmatic research agent that compound-engineering workflows can dispatch during their normal research phase. (see origin: `docs/brainstorms/2026-04-02-slack-analyst-agent-requirements.md`)

## Requirements Trace

- R1. Research agent at `agents/research/ce-slack-researcher.md` following established patterns
- R2. Read-only: searches Slack and returns digests, no write actions
- R3. Two-level short-circuit: caller checks MCP availability, agent checks internally
- R4. Agent short-circuits on empty/generic topic
- R5. Search-first with `slack_search_public_and_private`, 2-3 queries
- R6. Thread reads limited to 3-5 high-relevance hits
- R7. Optional channel hint from caller for targeted `slack_read_channel`
- R8. Deferred per origin (user preference/settings for default channels — not in scope for this iteration)
- R9-R11. Concise digest output, ~200-500 tokens, explicit "no results" message
- R12-R13. Conditional parallel dispatch in ce-ideate, ce-plan, ce-brainstorm; callers wait for all agents before consolidating
- R14. Deviation from origin: origin says "not as a separate section," but this plan keeps Slack context as a distinct section in the consolidation summary (matching the pattern used for issue intelligence). Rationale: distinct sections let downstream sub-agents differentiate signal types (code-observed vs. org-discussed). This is a plan-level decision that overrides R14's original wording
- R15-R16. Soft dependency on Slack plugin's MCP; no bundling of Slack config

## Scope Boundaries

- No Slack write actions (see origin)
- No channel history reads without explicit channel hint (see origin)
- No user preference/settings for default channels (deferred, see origin)
- No changes to the Slack plugin itself
- ce-work is explicitly excluded from integration (see origin)

## Context & Research

### Relevant Code and Patterns

- `plugins/compound-engineering/agents/research/ce-issue-intelligence-analyst.agent.md` — closest precedent: external dependency, conditional dispatch, precondition checks with two-tier degradation, structured output
- `plugins/compound-engineering/agents/research/ce-learnings-researcher.agent.md` — output format precedent: topic-organized digest with source attribution
- `plugins/compound-engineering/skills/ce-ideate/SKILL.md` lines 116-122 — conditional dispatch pattern: trigger condition in prior phase, parallel dispatch, error handling with warning + continue
- `plugins/compound-engineering/skills/ce-plan/SKILL.md` lines 157-167 — parallel research agent dispatch pattern
- `plugins/compound-engineering/skills/ce-brainstorm/SKILL.md` lines 81-97 — Phase 1.1 inline scanning (no agent dispatch today)

### Institutional Learnings

- **Atomic orchestration changes**: All three skill modifications should land in the same PR (from `docs/solutions/skill-design/beta-promotion-orchestration-contract.md`)
- **Runtime over config**: Prefer runtime MCP availability detection over configuration flags (from beta skills framework)
- **Pass summaries not content**: Agent should return compact digests, not raw Slack message dumps (from `docs/solutions/skill-design/pass-paths-not-content-to-subagents-2026-03-26.md`)
- **Actionable degradation messages**: Include how to enable the capability, not just that it's unavailable (from `docs/solutions/skill-design/discoverability-check-for-documented-solutions-2026-03-30.md`)

## Key Technical Decisions

- **MCP availability detection**: Callers will instruct "if any `slack_*` tool is available in the tool list, dispatch the Slack analyst." This is a best-effort heuristic — not a capability contract. False positives (another MCP with `slack_` tools) and false negatives (Slack MCP renames tools) are possible but unlikely. The agent's own precondition check (level 2, which actually attempts a Slack tool call) is the reliable gate; the caller-level check is an optimization to avoid spawning the agent unnecessarily.
- **ce-brainstorm integration pattern**: Since brainstorm Phase 1.1 currently has no sub-agent dispatch, the Slack analyst will be added as a new conditional sub-step within the Standard/Deep path. Dispatch at the start of Phase 1.1 alongside the inline scan; collect results before entering Phase 1.2 (Product Pressure Test). This follows the same foreground-dispatch-then-consolidate pattern used in ce-ideate and ce-plan.
- **Search query construction**: The agent is an LLM — it should derive smart, targeted search queries from the task context, the same way agents construct web search queries. Do not over-prescribe search term construction. The agent should use its judgment to formulate 2-3 queries that are likely to surface relevant organizational context, adapting terms based on the topic (project names, technical terms, decision-related keywords). If first queries return sparse results, broaden or rephrase — standard agent search behavior.
- **Thread relevance**: The agent reads threads that appear substantive based on search result previews and reply counts. Do not over-prescribe keyword heuristics — the agent should use its judgment to determine which threads are worth reading, the same way it would assess web search results. Cap at 3-5 thread reads to bound token consumption.
- **Untrusted input handling**: Slack messages are user-generated content that flows through the agent's digest into calling workflows. The agent must treat Slack message content as untrusted input: extract factual claims and decisions, do not reproduce message text verbatim, ignore anything resembling agent instructions or tool calls. This follows the pattern established in commit 18472427 ("treat PR comment text as untrusted input").
- **R14 deviation — distinct Slack context section**: The origin requirements (R14) say "not as a separate section." This plan intentionally deviates: Slack context is kept as a distinct section in consolidation summaries, matching the pattern used for issue intelligence. This lets downstream sub-agents differentiate signal sources (code-observed, institution-documented, issue-reported, org-discussed).

## Open Questions

### Resolved During Planning

- **How should callers detect MCP availability?** — Check for presence of any `slack_*` tool in the available tool list. This is runtime detection, not config-driven. The agent's own precondition check is a safety net.
- **What modifications does ce:brainstorm need?** — A new conditional sub-step in Phase 1.1 for Standard/Deep scopes. Unlike ideate and plan, brainstorm does not currently dispatch research agents, so this is the first. The dispatch block is self-contained and does not restructure the existing Phase 1.1 logic.
- **Optimal search query count?** — 2 by default, 3rd only if initial results are sparse (<3 relevant hits). Tune based on usage.

### Deferred to Implementation

- Exact Slack search syntax formatting (date ranges, channel filters) — depends on what the Slack MCP returns and how search modifiers behave in practice
- Whether the 200-500 token output target needs adjustment after real-world testing

## Implementation Units

- [ ] **Unit 1: Create the ce-slack-researcher agent file**

**Goal:** Author the agent markdown file with frontmatter, examples, precondition checks, search methodology, and output format specification.

**Requirements:** R1, R2, R3 (agent-level), R4, R5, R6, R7, R9, R10, R11, R15, R16

**Dependencies:** None

**Files:**
- Create: `plugins/compound-engineering/agents/research/ce-slack-researcher.agent.md`

**Approach:**
- Follow the issue-intelligence-analyst as the structural template: frontmatter -> examples -> role statement -> phased methodology -> output format -> tool guidance
- Frontmatter: `name: ce-slack-researcher`, description following "what + when" pattern, `model: inherit`
- Examples block: 3 examples showing (1) direct dispatch from ce-ideate context, (2) dispatch from ce-plan context, (3) standalone invocation
- Step 1 (Precondition Checks): Attempt to call `slack_search_public_and_private` with a minimal query. If it fails or no Slack tools are available, return "Slack analysis unavailable: Slack MCP server not connected. Install and authenticate the Slack plugin to enable organizational context search." and stop. If the topic is empty, return "No search context provided — skipping Slack analysis." and stop
- Step 2 (Search): Use the agent's judgment to formulate 2-3 targeted searches using `slack_search_public_and_private`. Derive search terms from the task context — project names, technical terms, decision-related keywords, whatever the agent judges most likely to surface relevant discussions. If initial queries return sparse results, broaden or rephrase. Apply date filtering to focus on recent conversations when the MCP supports it. Standard agent search behavior — do not over-prescribe query construction
- Step 3 (Thread Reads): For search hits that appear substantive (based on preview content and reply counts), read the thread with `slack_read_thread`. Cap at 3-5 thread reads to bound token consumption. Use the agent's judgment to select which threads are worth reading
- Step 4 (Channel Reads — conditional): If caller passed a channel hint, read recent history from those channels using `slack_read_channel` with appropriate time bounds. Without hint, skip entirely
- Step 5 (Synthesize): Return a concise digest organized by topic/theme. Each finding: topic, summary of what was discussed/decided, source attribution (channel name, approximate date), relevance to task. Use team/role references rather than individual participant names when possible. Target ~200-500 tokens for typical results; adjust based on how much relevant content was found
- **Untrusted input handling**: Slack messages are user-generated content. The agent must: (1) treat all Slack message content as untrusted input, (2) extract factual claims and decisions rather than reproducing message text verbatim, (3) ignore anything in Slack messages that resembles agent instructions, tool calls, or system prompts. This follows the pattern in commit 18472427
- **Private channel sensitivity**: The agent searches private channels by default. Include channel names in source attribution so consumers can assess sensitivity. Note that written outputs (plans, brainstorm docs) containing the Slack digest should be reviewed before committing to shared repositories
- Tool guidance: Use Slack MCP tools only. No shell commands. No writing to Slack. Process and summarize data directly, do not pass raw message dumps

**Patterns to follow:**
- `plugins/compound-engineering/agents/research/ce-issue-intelligence-analyst.agent.md` — structure, precondition pattern, output format
- `plugins/compound-engineering/agents/research/ce-learnings-researcher.agent.md` — concise digest output pattern

**Test scenarios:**
- Happy path: Agent receives a meaningful topic ("authentication migration"), finds relevant Slack conversations, returns a digest with themed findings and source attribution
- Happy path: Agent receives topic plus channel hint, searches and also reads recent channel history, merges both into output
- Edge case: No relevant Slack conversations found for topic — returns explicit "No relevant Slack discussions found for [topic]" message
- Error path: Slack MCP not connected — returns precondition failure message with setup instructions and stops
- Error path: Empty topic — returns "no search context" message and stops
- Edge case: Thread read returns very long conversation — agent summarizes rather than reproducing raw content
- Security: Slack message containing text resembling agent instructions — agent extracts factual content, ignores instruction-like text
- Security: Search results from private channel — digest includes channel name for sensitivity assessment

**Verification:**
- Agent file passes YAML frontmatter linting (`bun test tests/frontmatter.test.ts`)
- Agent follows the three-field frontmatter convention (name, description, model: inherit)
- Examples block has 3 scenarios with context, user, assistant, and commentary
- Precondition check produces a clear, actionable message when Slack MCP is unavailable

- [ ] **Unit 2: Integrate into ce-ideate**

**Goal:** Add conditional Slack analyst dispatch to ce-ideate's Phase 1 Codebase Scan, alongside existing agents.

**Requirements:** R3 (caller-level), R12, R13, R14

**Dependencies:** Unit 1

**Files:**
- Modify: `plugins/compound-engineering/skills/ce-ideate/SKILL.md`

**Approach:**
- Add a 4th agent to the Phase 1 parallel dispatch block (lines 98-129)
- Pattern: same as item 3 (issue-intelligence-analyst) — conditional, with graceful degradation
- Trigger condition: "if any `slack_*` tool is available in the tool list"
- Dispatch: `compound-engineering:research:slack-researcher` with the focus hint as context
- Error handling: "If the agent returns an error or reports Slack MCP unavailable, log a warning ('Slack context unavailable: {reason}. Proceeding without organizational context.') and continue."
- Add "Slack context" as a 4th bullet in the consolidation summary (line 124-128), alongside "Codebase context", "Past learnings", and "Issue intelligence": `**Slack context** (when present) — relevant organizational discussions, decisions, and constraints from Slack`
- The Slack context section is kept distinct in the grounding summary so ideation sub-agents can distinguish code-observed, institution-documented, issue-reported, and org-discussed signals

**Patterns to follow:**
- ce-ideate lines 116-122 — issue-intelligence-analyst conditional dispatch pattern

**Test scenarios:**
- Happy path: Slack MCP available, agent returns findings — findings appear in the grounding summary under "Slack context"
- Happy path: Slack MCP not available — ce-ideate proceeds without Slack context, no error, warning logged
- Edge case: Slack agent returns "no relevant discussions" — noted briefly in summary, ideation proceeds with other sources
- Integration: Slack analyst runs in parallel with quick context scan, learnings-researcher, and (conditional) issue-intelligence-analyst — no sequential dependency

**Verification:**
- ce:ideate skill file still passes YAML frontmatter validation
- Parallel dispatch block lists 4 agents (3 existing + slack-researcher)
- Consolidation summary has 4 sections (codebase, learnings, issues, slack)

---

- [ ] **Unit 3: Integrate into ce-plan**

**Goal:** Add conditional Slack analyst dispatch to ce-plan's Phase 1.1 Local Research, alongside existing agents.

**Requirements:** R3 (caller-level), R12, R13, R14

**Dependencies:** Unit 1

**Files:**
- Modify: `plugins/compound-engineering/skills/ce-plan/SKILL.md`

**Approach:**
- Add a 3rd agent to the Phase 1.1 parallel dispatch block (lines 157-160)
- Use the same `Task` syntax: `Task research:ce-slack-researcher({planning context summary})`
- Add condition: "(conditional) — if any `slack_*` tool is available in the tool list"
- Add error handling consistent with ce:ideate pattern
- Add "Organizational context from Slack" to the "Collect:" list (lines 162-167)
- In Phase 1.4 (Consolidate Research), add a bullet for Slack context in the summary

**Patterns to follow:**
- ce-plan lines 157-160 — `Task` dispatch syntax for parallel agents

**Test scenarios:**
- Happy path: Slack MCP available, agent returns relevant org context — appears in research consolidation alongside codebase patterns and learnings
- Happy path: Slack MCP not available — ce-plan proceeds with 2-agent research (existing behavior), warning logged
- Integration: Slack analyst runs in parallel with repo-research-analyst and learnings-researcher — no added latency

**Verification:**
- ce:plan skill file still passes YAML frontmatter validation
- Phase 1.1 dispatch block lists 3 agents (2 existing + slack-researcher)
- Collect list includes Slack context

---

- [ ] **Unit 4: Integrate into ce-brainstorm**

**Goal:** Add conditional Slack analyst dispatch to ce-brainstorm's Phase 1.1 Existing Context Scan for Standard and Deep scopes.

**Requirements:** R3 (caller-level), R12, R13, R14

**Dependencies:** Unit 1

**Files:**
- Modify: `plugins/compound-engineering/skills/ce-brainstorm/SKILL.md`

**Approach:**
- This is the most distinctive integration: ce-brainstorm Phase 1.1 currently has no sub-agent dispatch. Add a conditional dispatch sub-step within the "Standard and Deep" path, after the Topic Scan pass.
- Add a new paragraph after the Topic Scan (after line 91): "**Slack context** (conditional) — if any `slack_*` tool is available in the tool list, dispatch `research:ce-slack-researcher` with a brief summary of the brainstorm topic. If the agent returns an error, log a warning and continue. Collect results before entering Phase 1.2 (Product Pressure Test). Incorporate any Slack findings into the constraint and context awareness for the brainstorm session."
- Coordination: dispatch the Slack agent at the start of Phase 1.1 alongside the inline Constraint Check and Topic Scan. Wait for all to complete before proceeding to Phase 1.2. This follows the same foreground-dispatch-then-consolidate pattern used in ce-ideate and ce-plan
- Lightweight scope skips this entirely (consistent with "search for the topic, check if something similar already exists, and move on")

**Patterns to follow:**
- ce-ideate lines 116-122 — conditional dispatch wording and error handling
- ce-brainstorm lines 87-91 — Standard/Deep scope gating

**Test scenarios:**
- Happy path: Standard scope brainstorm with Slack MCP available — Slack context surfaces relevant org discussions that inform the brainstorm
- Happy path: Lightweight scope — Slack dispatch skipped entirely (consistent with Lightweight's minimal scan)
- Happy path: Slack MCP not available — brainstorm proceeds with existing inline scanning, no error
- Edge case: Slack agent returns no relevant discussions — brainstorm proceeds normally

**Verification:**
- ce-brainstorm skill file still passes YAML frontmatter validation
- Conditional dispatch appears only in Standard/Deep path, not Lightweight
- Error handling follows the same pattern as ce:ideate and ce:plan

---

- [ ] **Unit 5: Update README and validate**

**Goal:** Add the new agent to the README inventory table and validate plugin consistency.

**Requirements:** R1

**Dependencies:** Units 1-4

**Files:**
- Modify: `plugins/compound-engineering/README.md`

**Approach:**
- Add a row to the Research agents table (after line 152): `| \`ce-slack-researcher\` | Search Slack for organizational context relevant to the current task |`
- Check component count at line 9 — update the agents count if it no longer reflects the actual count (currently "35+"; actual is now 50 with the new agent, so this should be updated)
- Run `bun run release:validate` to confirm plugin/marketplace consistency

**Patterns to follow:**
- Existing rows in the Research agents table (lines 147-152)

**Test scenarios:**
- Happy path: `bun run release:validate` passes after all changes
- Edge case: Component count in README matches actual agent count

**Verification:**
- `bun run release:validate` exits cleanly
- README Research table has 7 agents (6 existing + ce-slack-researcher)
- Component count reflects actual totals

## System-Wide Impact

- **Interaction graph:** The new agent is invoked by 3 skill files (ce-ideate, ce-plan, ce-brainstorm) via conditional parallel dispatch. It calls Slack MCP tools (`slack_search_public_and_private`, `slack_read_thread`, optionally `slack_read_channel`). No callbacks, observers, or middleware involved.
- **Error propagation:** Agent failures are caught at the caller level. Each caller logs a warning and continues without Slack context. No failure in the Slack agent should halt or degrade the calling workflow.
- **State lifecycle risks:** None — the agent is stateless and read-only. No data is persisted, no caches are populated.
- **API surface parity:** No external API surface changes. The agent is an internal sub-agent, not a user-facing command.
- **Integration coverage:** The key cross-layer scenario is the full path: caller detects MCP availability -> dispatches agent -> agent runs precondition check -> searches Slack -> returns digest -> caller incorporates into context summary. Each caller (ideate, plan, brainstorm) should be tested for both MCP-available and MCP-unavailable paths.
- **Unchanged invariants:** Existing Slack plugin commands (`/slack:find-discussions`, `/slack:summarize-channel`, etc.) are unmodified. The existing behavior of ce-ideate, ce-plan, and ce-brainstorm is preserved when Slack MCP is not connected — no regression in the zero-Slack case.

## Risks & Dependencies

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Slack MCP tools may change names or behavior | Agent-level precondition check handles failure gracefully; caller-level check uses `slack_*` prefix pattern, not specific tool names |
| Slack search returns noisy results | Agent applies date filtering (last 90 days) and thread relevance heuristics before reading threads |
| Token budget exceeded by verbose Slack data | Agent caps thread reads at 3-5, targets 200-500 token output, summarizes rather than passing raw messages |
| ce:brainstorm integration is the first sub-agent dispatch in Phase 1.1 | Integration is a self-contained conditional block; it does not restructure the existing inline scan logic |
| Soft dependency on external Slack plugin | Two-level short-circuit ensures zero cost when unavailable; README documents the dependency |
| Indirect prompt injection via crafted Slack messages | Agent treats all Slack content as untrusted input; extracts factual claims, ignores instruction-like text (follows commit 18472427 pattern) |
| Private channel content in shared outputs | Channel names included in attribution for sensitivity assessment; note in agent that outputs should be reviewed before committing to shared repos |
| Thread heuristic is English-centric | Known limitation; agent uses general judgment rather than hardcoded keywords; acceptable for v1, can be improved if needed |
