 * One-time cleanup of stale compound-engineering files from previous installs.

 * The v3 rename changed all skill and agent names (e.g., git-commit -> ce-commit,
 * adversarial-reviewer -> ce-adversarial-reviewer). Target writers create new
 * files at the new paths but don't remove the old ones, leaving orphans that
 * confuse the agent runtime.
 *
 * This module lists the known old names and removes them from the target's
 * output directories. It's safe to run multiple times (idempotent) and safe
 * to remove entirely once the v2 -> v3 transition window has passed.

/**
 * Detect a stale Codex prompt wrapper using a two-signal ownership check.
 *
 * **Signal 1 — body instruction fingerprint.** The Codex converter writes
 * the following boilerplate deterministically when emitting a prompt wrapper
 * for an invocable command. These strings have remained stable across every
 * Codex-producing version of the plugin:
 *
 *   - `Use the $ce-plan skill for this command and follow its instructions.`
 *     (v2.39+ command-form wrapper)
 *   - `Use the ce:plan skill for this workflow and follow its instructions exactly.`
 *     (v2.55+ workflow-form wrapper, pre-rename)
 *   - `Use the ce-plan skill for this workflow and follow its instructions exactly.`
 *     (post-rename workflow-form wrapper)
 *
 * The "command" form is NOT exclusive to compound-engineering. `renderPrompt`
 * in `src/converters/claude-to-codex.ts` emits the same sentence (with a
 * different skill name) for every plugin that ships invocable commands. A
 * third-party plugin that happens to ship a same-named prompt wrapper (for
 * example, a fork that keeps the `ce-*` namespace) would produce a wrapper
 * whose body passes this signal alone.
 *
 * **Signal 2 — description ownership.** To avoid deleting another plugin's
 * wrapper out of a shared `~/.codex/prompts/` directory, we additionally
 * require the frontmatter `description:` to match either (a) the current
 * shipped description of the corresponding compound-engineering skill, or
 * (b) one of the historical descriptions we have shipped in a prior release
 * (`LEGACY_PROMPT_DESCRIPTION_ALIASES`). A wrapper with our body fingerprint
 * but a description that has never appeared in any compound-engineering
 * release is treated as NOT ours.
 *
 * Trade-off: adding a new release that reworks a prompt-related skill's
 * description means backfilling the previous description into the alias map
 * so upgrades from that version still clean up cleanly. Missing that backfill
 * only strands one orphan wrapper on upgrade (mild); matching too broadly
 * would delete a sibling plugin's file (destructive). Err on the side of
 * omission.

 *   - `"foreign"`: we have a fingerprint on record for this filename and the

 *
 * Rationale for the three-way split: `LEGACY_PROMPT_CURRENT_SKILL_FOR_FILE`
 * + `LEGACY_PROMPT_DESCRIPTION_ALIASES` only cover prompt filenames whose
 * corresponding ce-* skill is still shipped. For names that are fully
 * retired, we have no description to compare against, so a strict ownership
 * gate would strand genuinely-owned orphan wrappers. Reporting `"unknown"`
 * lets callers keep the historical allow-list behavior for those while still
 * gating the realistic collision vectors.
